# Customer Order Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing customer order data to uncover trends, insights, and potential areas for improvement in customer satisfaction and sales efficiency.

## Project Overview

In this data analysis project, Python is used to load, process, and analyze customer order data. The project employs popular libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to perform data cleaning, data transformation, and visualization. The analysis highlights key metrics like total sales, order frequency, and customer behavior, aiding in strategic decision-making for customer engagement and inventory management.

## Key Objectives

1. **Understand Customer Behavior**: Gain insights into purchasing patterns and customer preferences.
2. **Identify High-Value Products**: Analyze product performance and identify top-selling items.
3. **Improve Sales Strategy**: Leverage data-driven insights to optimize sales and marketing approaches.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, standardizing data formats, and removing outliers.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations and statistical analysis to understand the distribution of key variables and relationships within the data.
- **Sales Analysis**: Calculation of metrics like total sales, average order value, and order frequency.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Clustering customers based on purchase behavior to target high-value segments.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for interactive analysis)

To install the required packages, run:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Ensure `orders.csv` is in the project directory. This file contains the raw data used for analysis.
3. Open `Customer_Order_Analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run each cell sequentially to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.
